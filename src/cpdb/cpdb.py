        ### ABOUT CAPITAL PROJECTS DATABASE

        The Capital Projects Database (CPDB), a data product produced by the New York City (NYC) Department of City Planning (DCP) Capital Planning division, captures key data points on potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects sponsored or managed by a capital agency in and around NYC.

        Information reported in the Capital Commitment Plan published by the NYC Office of Management and Budget (OMB) three times per year is the foundation that CPDB is then built off of; therefore, only the capital projects that appear in the Capital Commitment Plan are reflected in CPDB. Other open data resources are also leveraged to map the capital projects.

        CPDB supports the most comprehensive map of potential, planned, and ongoing capital projects taking place across NYC enabling Planners to better understand and communicate New York Cityâ€™s capital project portfolio within and across particular agencies. This integrated but not exhaustive view provides a broad understanding of what projects are taking place within a certain area, and a starting point to discovering opportunities for strategic neighborhood planning.

        ### ABOUT QAQC 

        The QAQC page is designed to highlight key measures that can indicate potential data issues in a CPDB build. These graphs are aggregated at the agency level and there are essentially 3 cuts of the data that can be selected and viewed (w/ additional variation at the graph level):

        1. Type of agency: sponsoring agency OR managing agency 
        2. Focus on the commitment (Total sum ($) of all commitments) level data OR project (total number/count of projects) level data for each specific agency
        3. Select by project/commitment category type: entire portfolio/all categories (fixed asset, lump sum, ITT, Vehicles & equpment) OR only fixed asset

        Additionally, we have created basic geographic checks to facilitate the QAQC process of the disparate source data we recieve from various city agencies. These checks are not meant to be comprehensive but indicate if a source data geometry is falling outside of the NYC spatial boundaries.

        ### Key CPDB QAQC terms: 

        **Mapped** - refers to a record that is succesfully geocoded and "mapped" to a location in NYC (point, polygon or line)
