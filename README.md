# Data Engineering Quality Control and Assurance Application

This web application displays charts and tables to assess the consistency, quality and completeness of a particular build of one of data engineering's data products.
It's written in Python using the [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) framework.

Best practice to run the app locally is to use the dev container

The deployed app is at https://edm-data-engineering.nycplanningdigital.com/?page=Home
